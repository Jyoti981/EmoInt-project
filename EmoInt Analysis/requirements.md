# Sentiment Analysis Machine Learning Model

## 1. Libraries and Packages Used:
**The following libraries and packages were utilized in the development of the sentiment analysis model:**

* Python: Programming language used for development.

* scikit-learn: Machine learning library for model training and evaluation.

* numpy: Library for numerical computing.

* pandas: Library for data manipulation and analysis.

* matplotlib: Library for data visualization.

* NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): Library for NLP tasks such as text preprocessing.

* spaCy: Library for advanced NLP tasks such as named entity recognition.

* pickle: Python module for object serialization.

## 3. Model Directory Structure
**The sentiment analysis model directory structure is organized as follows:**

* data: Directory containing the training, development, and testing datasets.

* models: Directory containing the trained regression models for each emotion.

* src: Directory containing the source code for model training, testing, and evaluation.
